# See_You_Next_Year_Planner

## Background

I plan on creating a webpage that can help people to create a planner to help their diet plans stay on track. With a variety of healthy food options suitable for building a healthy diet menu, the user will be able to build their own menu on the sidebar. Meanwhile, the webpage will also show each food optionâ€™s calories, protein, and fat content. Most importantly, to differentiate from other similar diet planning apps, this webpage will show the predicted body shape of the user if they followed the diet plan
