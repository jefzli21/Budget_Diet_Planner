# Budget_Diet_Planner

Background

I plan on creating a webpage that can help people to create a planner to help their diet plans stay on track. With a variety of healthy food options suitable for building a healthy diet menu, the user will be able to build their own menu on the sidebar. Meanwhile, the webpage will also show each food optionâ€™s calories, protein, and fat content. Most importantly, to differentiate from other similar diet planning apps, this webpage will show the average price for one serving of the selected food option. At the bottom of the sidebar, after all the food options have been added, the total calories, protein, and fat content will be summed up and displayed. It will also include the total estimated price of this meal plan. The unique aspect of this planner would be the financial data that I will be drawing from the Bureau of Labor Statistic.



Functionality & MVPs
With this Budget Diet Planner, users will be able to:

See the nutritional data and average cost on a variety of healthy food
Select food items and log them into the planner in the sidebar
See a calculated total nutritional value and predicted cost of the diet plan
Remove unwant items from the list

In addition, this project will include:
As a bonus feature, the website will show the predicted body shape in six months of the user if followed strictly by the chosen diet plan.
An About modal describing the background and the usage of the planner
A production README

Implementation Timeline
NB:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the pulling data using API.

Monday: Dedicate this day toward implementing the basic layout of the page

Tuesday: Implement the calculation,storing and removing functionalities of the page

Wednesday: Finish implementing user controls, and focus on styling, as well as implementing the different color schemes.

Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
